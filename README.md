# LemonedgePhoneChess

This project was a take home assessment for Lemonedge. The purpose is to calculate the total moves each type of chess piece
could make if placed on a phone keypad while following specific rules. Ultimately I did not get the correct answer, but I'm
leaving this project up as I believe it demonstrates good OOP practices.
